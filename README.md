## C# Projects

### UAD
Simple Active Directory User Administration Dashboard
A simple desktop application that was originally started to be an all in one tool for the helpdesk agents that did not have direct access to the tools for these operations. Before I finished it they decided to go another route and use ADAC instead so this application was shelved.

### SFM-Apps-Page

This is a rewrite of a React application that had been purchased in the past, but require hand editing of JSON data to add/modify entries.  I wrote the front end in Angular and the backend using a C# Web App and API based on an SQLite database.

## Java Projects

### Capstone

This is the Capstone project from a Java class one of my co-workers was taking.  I decided to do the project for fun after he told me about his assignment.
